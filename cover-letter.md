Dear Jason,

Three years ago, I left academia for software engineering. Full-time research wasn't a good fit, and neither was the prospect of relocating to chase faculty positions. The hard part was giving up teaching after ten-plus semesters of pre-med physics, musical acoustics, and even ballroom dance.

Since then, I've pursued mentorship and outreach at every opportunity. This is my third summer mentoring an intern at Cray. I've presented hour-long tech forums to introduce hundreds of my peers to new technologies. Over the winter, I spent my Saturdays volunteer-coaching a Special Olympics powerlifting team. These experiences have left me restless for more, which is why I'm excited to apply to teach at St Olaf.

I believe my unusual career path would be an asset to the department. If my year was any indication, at least a third of physics majors end up writing software. I've got plenty of experience to share as far as internships, recruiters, and technologies -- not to mention career path uncertainty!

I look forward to hearing from you. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions.

Sincerely,

Charles








I've even made it back to St Olaf a few times to speak at Piper Center career events.

I also believe my unusual career path presents a novel

This has all left me hungry for more.




I'm excited at the possibility of returning to St Olaf as a professor.

I hope I can stir up some excitement on your end as well.
