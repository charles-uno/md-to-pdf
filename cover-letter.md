To Whom it May Concern,

Three years ago, I left academia for software engineering. Full-time research wasn't a good fit, and neither was the prospect of relocating to chase faculty positions. The hard part was walking away from ten-plus semesters of teaching -- pre-med physics, musical acoustics, and (once) ballroom dance.

Since then, I've pursued education and outreach at every opportunity. This is my third summer mentoring an intern. I've presented hour-long tech forums to introduce hundreds of my peers to new technologies. Over the winter, I spent my Saturdays volunteer-coaching a Special Olympics powerlifting team. This has all left me hungry for more. I'm excited at the possibility of returning to St Olaf to teach.

I hope I can stir up some excitement on your end as well. My unusual career path presents an opportunity for St Olaf students. If my year was any indication, at least a third of physics majors end up writing software.





Cray's last corporate re-org gave me plenty of experience to share

They'll need to polish their resumes, court recruiters,


disproportionate

I'd also like to believe my application is not entirely selfish.
A third of my St Olaf physics class ended up writing software. Many of today's physics majors will too.

If they're curious about finding an internship,
working with recruiters
writing a resume
exploring new technologies
leveraging competing offers
surviving a corporate reorganization
or even just what it's like working in the private sector

Those sort of questions weren't on my radar when I was a student -- but I wish they had been.
