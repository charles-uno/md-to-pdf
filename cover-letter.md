Dear Jason,

Three years ago, I left academia for software engineering. Full-time research wasn't a good fit, and neither was the prospect of relocating to chase faculty positions. The hard part was walking away from ten-plus semesters of teaching pre-med physics, musical acoustics, and (once) ballroom dance.

Since then, I've pursued education and outreach at every opportunity. This is my third summer mentoring an intern. I've presented hour-long tech forums to introduce hundreds of my peers to new technologies. Over the winter, I spent my Saturdays volunteer-coaching a Special Olympics powerlifting team. This has all left me hungry for more. I'm excited at the possibility of returning to St Olaf as a professor.

I hope I can stir up some excitement on your end as well. My unusual career path presents an opportunity for St Olaf students. If my year was any indication, at least a third of physics majors end up writing software. I've got plenty of experience to share as far as internships, recruiters, and technologies -- not to mention career path uncertainty! 

I look forward to hearing from you. 

Sincerely, 
Charles
