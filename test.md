If you're writing a document that'll be released to the public, Microsoft Word (or similar) is probably the tool for you. You can pull in your organization's letterhead, tweak fonts and colors, drop in some images, and wrap the text around them. With a bit of finagling, Word's under-the-hood HTML[^1] gives you the horsepower to do basically whatever you want.

[^1]: If you change the `.docx` extension to `.zip`, you can unzip a Word document and look at the HTML and style elements for yourself!
